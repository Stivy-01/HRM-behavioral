## Evaluation Plan

Predictive metrics: top-k, perplexity, calibration; stratify by setup, genotype, time-of-day.

Baselines: n-gram/Markov (1–3), HMM, GRU/Transformer.

Latent analysis: H-level embeddings; MI/enrichment; dwell/transition stats.

PPC: unigram/bigram JSD; dwell KS; transition entropy; run-lengths.

Stress/genotype: linear probes; baseline→stress deltas; genotype interaction.
