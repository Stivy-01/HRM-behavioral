Absolutely — you can adapt the Sapientinc's Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) (distinct from HMM) to analyze animal behavior sequences. This architecture, featuring a high-level planning module (H-module) and a low-level execution module (L-module), can be trained to capture both abstract patterns and fine-grained details in behavioral data—even if it was originally built for reasoning tasks like mazes and Sudoku

What Is Sapientinc’s HRM?

Two-tier recurrent architecture:

High-level module: Handles slowly evolving, abstract patterns.

Low-level module: Manages fast-changing, detailed behaviors.

Originally designed for reasoning tasks such as solving complex puzzles and mazes, with only ~27 million parameters, achieving high performance with minimal training data

Applying HRM to Animal Behavior Data

Your dataset consists of time-ordered behavioral events (like Approach, Get away, Social escape, etc.), enriched with features such as duration, SETUP (stress vs. neutral), and GENOTYPE.

This aligns well with HRM’s structure:

Module	Analogy in Your Data
H-module	Encodes overarching behavioral modes (e.g., affiliative vs. avoidance states)
L-module	Captures immediate, concrete actions (e.g., approach, retreat)
Steps to Adapt HRM for Behavior Analysis
1. Data Preprocessing

Tokenize each observed behavior into discrete codes (e.g., “Approach” → 1, “Get away” → 2, etc.).

Optionally embed continuous features (duration, genotype, setup) into vectors and inject them into the low-level module.

2. Model Setup

Clone and install the HRM repository from GitHub, importing necessary modules (pretrain.py, dataset/build_arc_dataset.py) for guidance on structure 
GitHub

.

Adapt the input pipeline to accept your behavioral sequences instead of puzzles.

3. Training Strategy

Treat behavior sequences as “puzzles”: the goal is to predict the next behavior in the sequence based on previous actions.

Train HRM to minimize next-step prediction loss. Over time, the model will develop latent hierarchical representations of behavior dynamics.

4. Interpretation

Extract hidden states from the H-module as inferred behavioral modes.

Analyze transition probabilities between these latent states to see if, for example, stress vs neutral setups or different genotypes show distinctive dynamics.

Visualize latent trajectories across conditions to spot motifs or stereotyped patterns invisible in raw counts.

Benefits and Considerations

Advantages:

HRM can capture hierarchical and multi-scale behavior patterns.

It’s efficient and effective with modest data volumes, suitable for your experiment sizes.

Considerations:

The original design was for spatial/visual puzzles, not sequential behaviors—so careful preprocessing and model tuning will be needed.

Community feedback suggests HRM needs clearer examples for new domains

Summary

Sapientinc’s HRM is a compelling alternative to HMMs for your use case. Its dual-level reasoning structure allows modeling both latent behavioral states and concrete actions, potentially revealing complex patterns driven by stress or genotype.

Would you like help drafting a PyTorch-based training pipeline—mapping your behavior sequences into HRM inputs, handling features, training loops, and analyzing latent outputs?

Hai detto:
no first before diving into it i want a clear plan of action, lets say i completed the tokenizing how can I handle the task difference?
ChatGPT ha detto:

Great — that’s the right mindset 👍.
Since Sapientic/HRM was built for reasoning tasks like puzzles, and your task is sequential animal behavior, we need to think carefully about the task adaptation strategy. Here’s a structured plan of action after tokenizing your behaviors:

📌 Step 1: Clarify the Task Differences
HRM Original Use	Your Use Case	Challenge
Solving mazes, Sudoku, ARC tasks → structured reasoning with clear “correct answers”	Modeling sequences of animal behaviors without explicit “right answer”	How to define learning objective
Input = structured puzzles (images, grids, symbolic tokens)	Input = sequences of behavioral tokens (with metadata like duration, setup, genotype)	Input format mismatch
Output = exact solution (classification/regression)	Output = patterns, latent states, sequence prediction	Different target definition

So the core difference: HRM was trained for supervised solution-finding, while your problem is more like sequence modeling / unsupervised representation learning.

📌 Step 2: Decide on the Learning Objective

You need to define what the model will learn. Some candidate tasks:

Next-event prediction (self-supervised)

Train HRM to predict the next behavior token in a sequence.

Forces the model to capture latent structure (like language models do).

Sequence reconstruction (autoencoder style)

Input = sequence of behaviors.

Output = reconstruct same sequence.

Hidden representation in H-module captures “latent behavioral states.”

Condition classification (supervised auxiliary task)

Predict experimental setup (stress vs. neutral) or genotype from sequences.

Hidden states still capture behavioral dynamics but grounded in experimental labels.

👉 My suggestion: start with next-event prediction (self-supervised), then optionally fine-tune for classification.

📌 Step 3: Adapt Inputs to HRM

Behavior tokens → IDs (like words in NLP).

Metadata (duration, genotype, setup) → additional embeddings, concatenated with token embeddings before feeding into L-module.

Sequences → chunked into fixed windows (e.g., 50–100 events per sequence) for batch training.

📌 Step 4: Adapt HRM Architecture

L-Module (fast dynamics): Models short-term event transitions (e.g., Approach → Contact → Get away).

H-Module (slow dynamics): Captures higher-level modes (e.g., “affiliative,” “avoidance,” “exploration”).

So instead of reasoning over puzzle grids, the two modules now handle multi-scale temporal dynamics.

📌 Step 5: Training

Loss = cross-entropy on next-event prediction.

Optionally add a multi-task loss (e.g., predict condition label at the sequence level).

Monitor:

Prediction accuracy (do latent states improve predictive power?)

Cluster structure in H-module embeddings (do hidden states correspond to meaningful behavioral modes?).

📌 Step 6: Analysis After Training

Extract hidden trajectories from H-module.

Cluster or visualize with t-SNE/UMAP → do stress vs neutral conditions separate?

Analyze transition dynamics: probability of moving between latent states.

Compare across genotype and setup conditions.

✅ In summary:

Convert behaviors → tokens.

Reframe task: instead of “solve puzzle,” HRM does “predict next event” (self-supervised).

L-module captures short-term event transitions, H-module captures latent behavioral modes.

Train on event prediction, analyze latent states for hidden structure.

Would you like me to map this plan into a step-by-step experimental workflow (like a checklist you can follow in order: preprocessing → model setup → training → analysis)?

Hai detto:
wait but how can you be so sure it can be a usecase?
ChatGPT ha detto:

That’s a very fair pushback — you’re right to be cautious before committing. Let me unpack why I think HRM could work, and also where the uncertainty lies.

🔹 Why HRM might fit your use case

Nature of your data = sequential, hierarchical

Animal behavior is not flat — it has micro-actions (approach, sniff, rear) that compose into higher-level motifs (affiliation, avoidance).

HRM was designed to capture fast-changing signals in the L-module and slow, abstract dynamics in the H-module → this aligns very well with behavior structure.

Generalizable architecture

Even though HRM was shown on puzzles (ARC, Sudoku, mazes), its design is not puzzle-specific. It’s a general recurrent hierarchy.

In theory, any structured, sequential task (like behavior sequences) could be modeled.

Token-based inputs

HRM already works with symbolic tokens (in ARC, objects/pixels are abstracted into symbolic inputs).

Your behaviors can be tokenized the same way → minimal conceptual mismatch.

🔹 Why it’s not guaranteed to work

Original objective mismatch

HRM was trained in supervised reasoning tasks with ground-truth answers.

Your problem is closer to unsupervised sequence modeling → we’d need to redefine the training objective (e.g., next-event prediction, reconstruction).

Model maturity

HRM is still relatively new and experimental. It hasn’t been tested in ethology or sequence modeling domains (at least, no published studies yet).

That means extra engineering effort is required to adapt it.

Data requirements

If your dataset is small, HRM might not show its advantages over simpler models like HMMs, LSTMs, or Transformers.

It shines when there’s enough complexity in the sequences to justify hierarchical reasoning.

🔹 So… Is it a viable use case?

Yes, conceptually: animal behavior analysis matches HRM’s hierarchical design philosophy.

But not proven: you’d be doing method adaptation / exploratory work, not applying a plug-and-play model.

Alternative baseline: Before committing to HRM, you could run simpler models (HMM, GRU, Transformer) to check if your dataset exhibits structure that benefits from hierarchy. If yes → HRM might add value.

✅ Bottom line:
It’s not that I’m sure HRM will work — it’s that its architecture is well-aligned in principle, but it requires reframing the learning task and might demand more work than simpler models.

Do you want me to draw a decision roadmap (HRM vs HMM vs LSTM/Transformer) so you can see when HRM is the right choice, and when you might be better off with simpler models?

Hai detto:
i know there are some papers using my same raw data that built sequences and spot differences between mice so we have a proof that is some sequence in behaviors, my question is how can i say that hrm did a good job?
ChatGPT ha detto:
Ragionato per 13s

Great question. Define “did a good job” before training. For HRM on behavior sequences, judge it on three axes:

1) Predictive performance (objective success)

Pick a concrete learning objective (e.g., next-event prediction). Then evaluate on held-out animals/sessions.

Top-k next-event accuracy (k=1,3,5)

Per-token log-likelihood / perplexity

Calibration (Brier score; reliability curves)

Multi-step forecasting: accuracy/LL for t+1…t+N

Acceptance: HRM must beat simple sequence baselines:

n-gram/Markov (order 1–3)

HMM (tuned #states)

Single-layer GRU/LSTM

Small Transformer

Use leave-one-animal-out and leave-one-day-out splits to ensure generalization.

2) Scientific usefulness (latent structure that matters)

HRM should reveal interpretable, stable structure that aligns with biology.

A. Segmentation/States

Extract H-module representations (or discrete states if you quantize).

Stability: test–retest similarity across runs (e.g., ARI/V-measure between clusterings).

Parsimony: few states with clear dwell times and transitions.

Interpretability probes:

Mutual information between latent state and known labels (SETUP/GENOTYPE).

Correlation with bout features (speed, duration).

State-condition enrichment (permutation test / χ² with FDR).

B. Condition separability (did it capture differences between mice?)

Train a simple linear classifier on frozen HRM embeddings to predict SETUP or GENOTYPE.

Report AUC / accuracy on held-out animals.

Compare to the same classifier on raw features and on HMM state posteriors.

C. Motif discovery

Mine frequent n-grams or variable-length motifs in the decoded latent sequence.

Compare motif frequency/rank between conditions; test with permutation/bootstrapping.

Map motifs back to human-readable behaviors for face validity.

3) Generative adequacy (does HRM reproduce the statistics of behavior?)

Posterior predictive checks (PPC) using sequences sampled from HRM:

Unigram/bigram/k-gram frequencies vs. real (JS-divergence)

Transition entropy; bout length distributions (KS tests)

Run-lengths of key behaviors (e.g., “get away” streaks)

State dwell times and switching rates

Cross-condition simulation: condition the model on STRESS vs NEUTRAL and see if simulated differences match empirical ones.

HRM “does a good job” if simulated data matches these statistics within confidence intervals and better than baselines.

Practical evaluation plan (checklist)

Pre-register your objective(s) and metrics.

Data splits: LOAO (by animal) + LODO (by day).

Train HRM (next-event objective). Early-stop on validation LL.

Baselines: 1–3-order Markov, HMM (grid of states), GRU, small Transformer.

Report on test sets:

Predictive: top-k, LL, calibration.

Latent: MI with labels, enrichment tests, clustering stability.

Generative: PPC suite (n-gram/JSD, KS for durations, dwell/switch).

Condition decoding AUC from frozen embeddings.

Statistics: bootstrap CIs; paired tests vs each baseline; FDR control.

Ablations: remove H-module (L-only), remove duration/metadata, shuffle order → quantify performance drops (does hierarchy actually help?).

Interpretability deliverables: transition diagrams, latent-state ethograms, motif heatmaps, per-condition state occupancy with CIs.

Concrete success criteria (example)

≥10–20% relative improvement in test perplexity over best baseline.

AUC ≥ 0.75 for condition decoding from HRM embeddings and ≥0.05 absolute over HMM embeddings.

PPC: JSD for bigram distribution below a pre-set threshold and significantly lower than baselines.

Stable latent states (ARI between runs ≥ 0.6) and biologically meaningful enrichment (q < 0.05).

Clear ablation drop when removing the H-module (shows hierarchy is doing real work).

If HRM meets (most of) these, you can credibly say it “did a good job” both computationally and scientifically.

# Behavioral Transition Analysis Code Summary

## Overview
This Python script analyzes behavioral transitions between exclusive events in animal studies, likely involving mouse behavioral analysis. It processes SQLite databases containing animal detection and behavioral event data.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Processing Functions
- **computeTransitionsBetweenExclusiveEventsPerFile()**: Core function that:
  - Loads animal data from SQLite database files
  - Analyzes transitions between different behavioral events
  - Groups animals by genotype and sex
  - Calculates transition probabilities between behaviors
  - Exports results to JSON files

### 2. Visualization Functions
- **featureHeatMap()**: Creates heatmaps showing effect sizes and p-values for statistical comparisons

  - Node sizes representing behavior frequency
- **plotTransitionOccurrencesPerGeno()**: Plots transition patterns per genotype
- **plotHeatmapEffectSizePVal()**: Statistical comparison visualization

### 3. Behavioral Events Analyzed
The script analyzes transitions between exclusive behavioral categories including:
- Various contact behaviors (oral-oral, oral-genital, side-by-side)
- Isolated movement behaviors (move, stop)
- Other contact and undetected states

### 4. Interactive Menu System
The script provides 6 main analysis options:

#### Option 1: Compute Transitions Over Time Periods
- **1**: Full night analysis
- **1a**: Specific duration analysis  
- **1b**: Analysis from paused frame

#### Option 3: Group Analysis
- **3**: Plot transitions per genotype

#### Option 4-5: Statistical Analysis
- **4**: Compare two conditions statistically
- **5**: Analyze single dataset statistically

### 5. Statistical Methods
- Uses Mann-Whitney U tests or t-tests depending on data normality
- Applies Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests to check assumptions
- Calculates effect sizes with small sample corrections
- Implements multiple comparison corrections

### 6. Output Formats
- **JSON files**: Store computed transition data
- **PNG/PDF plots**: Network graphs and heatmaps
- **Statistical visualizations**: Effect size and significance plots

## Data Structure
The analysis works with:
- **Animals**: Identified by RFID, with genotype and sex attributes
- **Events**: Time-stamped behavioral occurrences with start/end frames
- **Transitions**: Sequences where one behavior immediately follows another

## Use Case
This appears to be designed for behavioral genetics research, comparing how different genotypes (likely control vs. mutant mice) exhibit different patterns of social and individual behaviors, and how these behaviors transition from one to another over time.

The script is particularly useful for:
- Ethological studies
- Behavioral phenotyping
- Social behavior analysis
- Genetic effects on behavior patterns

this is a try people did 4 years ago to create sequences. can it be useful for us or is out of context?
ChatGPT ha detto:

This is very relevant to what you want to do — it’s not out of context at all. Let me explain why and how it connects to HRM:

🔹 What that old script does

Takes raw behavioral events → turns them into transition matrices (probabilities of A → B).

Visualizes those as graphs and heatmaps.

Runs group-level statistics (genotype, condition).

Core idea: “sequences of behaviors matter, not just frequencies.”

So it’s a first-generation sequence analysis pipeline: Markov-chain–style, mostly descriptive + statistical.

🔹 How this helps you now

It already formalizes behavior as sequences (exclusive states, transitions) — which is exactly the preprocessing step you need before trying HRM.

It gives you baseline analyses: you can compare HRM’s latent structure against the “old-school” transition matrices.
👉 Example: If HRM’s hidden states reproduce or refine the transitions this code detects, you have proof HRM is meaningful.

It shows domain expectations: reviewers or collaborators will recognize this style of analysis because it’s established in behavioral genetics.

🔹 Where it falls short compared to HRM

Assumes first-order transitions (Markov): only immediate behavior→behavior, no memory beyond that.

No hierarchy: can’t model higher-level “modes” like HRM’s H-module.

Mostly group-level summary; doesn’t exploit full sequences for pattern discovery.

Statistical rather than representational: you get p-values, but not rich latent embeddings.

🔹 How to use it alongside HRM

Baseline benchmark

Run this pipeline to produce transition matrices.

HRM must at least recover or improve upon these transitions in predictive checks.

Evaluation metric

Use this pipeline’s outputs (transition distributions, effect size comparisons) as posterior predictive checks:

Does HRM-generated synthetic data reproduce these transition graphs?

Does HRM separate genotypes/conditions at least as well?

Hybrid approach

Feed HRM’s latent state sequences into the old pipeline: treat HRM states as “behaviors” and build transition graphs/heatmaps from them.

This gives a direct, interpretable comparison with the traditional analysis style.

✅ Bottom line:
This script is not out of context — it’s actually a useful baseline and evaluation tool. Think of it as your “control experiment” in analysis:

Old script = shallow sequence statistics (Markov, transitions).

HRM = deeper hierarchical representation.

If HRM outperforms or refines what the old script sees, you have strong evidence it “did a good job.”

Would you like me to sketch how to connect the two — i.e., a workflow where you (1) run this old pipeline, (2) run HRM, and (3) compare results head-to-head? That would make your evaluation framework much more concrete.

Hai detto:
no i need a full recap on how to tokenize my data for hrm and a sample of test train split dataset on how it should look structurally, dont give me code, just explain
ChatGPT ha detto:

Perfect — let’s zoom in on the tokenization and what the HRM-ready dataset should look like.
No code, just structure and reasoning 👇

🔹 1. What “tokenizing” means here

Your raw data = time-stamped behaviors like Approach, Get away, Social escape, Stop with metadata (startframe, duration, genotype, setup).

To feed this into HRM, you need to:

Map behaviors → discrete tokens (like words in NLP).

Optionally embed metadata (duration, setup, genotype) as additional features.

Arrange tokens in temporal order → sequences of events.

So the tokenization is essentially “turn behavior logs into sequences of symbols/embeddings”.

🔹 2. Levels of tokenization
A. Behavior tokens (mandatory)

Each behavior type gets an integer ID:

Approach → 1

Get away → 2

Stop → 3

Social escape → 4

… etc.

This becomes your base sequence.

B. Extra features (optional, HRM can use them)

For each token, you can attach side-information:

Duration (quantized into bins: short, medium, long).

Setup (stress = 1, neutral = 0).

Genotype (wt = 0, mutant = 1).

These can be concatenated to the token embedding.
If you keep it simple at first, start with just behavior tokens.

🔹 3. Structuring the sequences

Each animal/session becomes a sequence of tokens ordered in time.

Example (just behaviors):

Animal A (neutral, wt):
[Approach, Contact, Get away, Stop, Approach, Contact, ...]
→ [1, 5, 2, 3, 1, 5, ...]

Animal B (stress, mutant):
[Stop, Social escape, Get away, Stop, Stop, ...]
→ [3, 4, 2, 3, 3, ...]


If you add metadata, each element becomes a tuple:

(token_id, duration_bin, setup, genotype)
(1, 2, 0, 0)
(5, 1, 0, 0)
(2, 3, 0, 0)
...

🔹 4. Train / test split strategy

Because this is animal data, you must split carefully to avoid leakage.

Best practice splits

By animal: Entire sequences from Animal A in train, Animal B in test.

By session/day (if multiple days per animal): Some days in train, other days in test.

Avoid splitting within a sequence (HRM needs coherent full sequences).

Example split

Train set: 80% of animals (all their sequences).

Validation: 10% of animals.

Test set: 10% of animals.

So your dataset looks like this structurally:

train/
   animal_01_sequence.json
   animal_02_sequence.json
   ...
val/
   animal_11_sequence.json
test/
   animal_15_sequence.json


Each file (or row) contains:

{
  "id": "animal_01",
  "genotype": "wt",
  "setup": "neutral",
  "sequence": [
      (1, 2, 0, 0),
      (5, 1, 0, 0),
      (2, 3, 0, 0),
      ...
  ]
}

🔹 5. Why this matters for HRM

L-module: learns the fast dynamics of token-to-token transitions.

H-module: learns slower patterns (clusters of behaviors across time).

With this structured dataset, HRM can simulate, predict, and discover latent behavioral modes.

✅ In summary:

Convert each behavior → token ID.

Optionally add duration/setup/genotype as extra categorical features.

Build full time-ordered sequences per animal/session.

Split data by animal/session, not within sequences.

Store as lists of tokens (with optional tuples) inside train/val/test sets.

Do you want me to also lay out two concrete example dataset snippets — one minimal (tokens only) and one rich (tokens + metadata) — so you can visualize exactly how your data rows should look before HRM training?

Hai detto:
the fact is that i have individual behaviors, dyadic behaviors, group behaviors and 3 animal group behaviors. for a total of 4 animal per experiment
ChatGPT ha detto:

That’s a really important clarification 👍 — your experiments are multi-animal and with multiple social levels of behavior. This changes how you tokenize, because you’re not just dealing with one flat timeline, but interacting streams.

Let’s break it down:

🔹 1. Levels of behavioral annotation you have

Individual behaviors → things an animal does alone (move, stop, rear).

Dyadic behaviors → interactions between 2 animals (approach, follow, contact).

Triadic behaviors → interactions among 3 animals (two chasing one, etc.).

Group behaviors (4 animals) → full-group states (all huddling, all exploring).

So each experiment is a nested structure: multiple animals × multiple social levels.

🔹 2. Tokenization strategy options
Option A: Flatten into a single timeline

For each experiment, you create a joint event sequence where every event (no matter if individual/dyadic/group) is treated as a token in the same vocabulary.

Vocabulary looks like:

Individual: Move_A1, Stop_A3

Dyadic: Approach_A1_A2, Contact_A2_A4

Triadic: Chase_A1_A2_A3

Group: All_huddle_A1_A2_A3_A4

This captures who + what, but vocabulary grows fast.

Useful if you want HRM to learn entire group dynamics in one sequence.

Option B: Separate streams per animal

Each animal has its own token sequence, made of its individual actions plus dyadic/group events that involve it.

Example for Animal A1:
[Move, Approach(A1→A2), Chased(A2+A3→A1), GroupHuddle]

Then you either:

Train HRM per-animal (each is its own dataset).

Or train jointly with multi-stream batching.

This makes comparisons between animals easier (e.g., genotype differences), but loses the global synchrony a bit.

Option C: Factorized representation (multi-channel)

Think of your data as parallel tracks:

Channel 1 = individual behaviors

Channel 2 = dyadic interactions

Channel 3 = triadic

Channel 4 = group

At each time step, the token is a tuple:

(individual_token, dyadic_token, triadic_token, group_token)


Missing channels = “NULL”.

HRM sees multi-scale behavior at once, but input design gets heavier.

🔹 3. Train/test split

Because you have 4 animals per experiment:

Split by experiment (not within animals), so the whole group stays together.

Example: 8 experiments total → 6 for train, 1 for val, 1 for test.

This ensures generalization to new groups of animals.

🔹 4. Structuring the dataset

Let’s say you choose Option B (per-animal streams) (often most practical at first):

train/
   exp01_animalA1.json
   exp01_animalA2.json
   exp01_animalA3.json
   exp01_animalA4.json
   exp02_animalA1.json
   ...
val/
   exp07_animalA1.json
   ...
test/
   exp08_animalA1.json
   ...


Each file would look like:

{
  "experiment_id": "exp01",
  "animal_id": "A1",
  "genotype": "wt",
  "sex": "M",
  "setup": "stress",
  "sequence": [
      "Move",
      "Approach_A1_A2",
      "Stop",
      "Contact_A1_A3",
      "GroupHuddle",
      ...
  ]
}


If instead you want Option A (one big group timeline), each experiment would have a single sequence of mixed tokens like:

[ "Move_A1", "Approach_A1_A2", "Contact_A2_A4", "GroupHuddle_A1_A2_A3_A4", ... ]

🔹 5. Which option fits HRM best?

If your scientific question = group-level social dynamics → Option A (flatten group into one timeline).

If your question = how individuals differ (e.g., genotype effects) → Option B (per-animal streams).

If you want to preserve full richness → Option C (factorized, multi-channel), but that requires more careful model adaptation.

✅ In short:

You can tokenize at different granularity (flat group events vs per-animal streams).

For 4-animal experiments, I’d start with Option B (per-animal sequences): simpler, interpretable, and easy to align with baseline analyses.

Later, you can extend to Option A or C if you want full-group modeling.

Do you want me to mock up a concrete mini-example sequence (say 10 time steps for 4 animals) showing how the same raw data would look under Option A, B, and C? That way you can directly compare which feels natural for your HRM pipeline.

Hai detto:
since i have 18 experiments, 8 all wt 3 mutant_1 and 7 mutant_2, all composed roughly with 7 days of data, with frame resolution, how much compute power do i need?
ChatGPT ha detto:

That’s a key practical question 👌 — let’s break it down step by step so you have a realistic picture.

🔹 1. What your dataset actually looks like

18 experiments (4 animals each → 72 animals total).

Each experiment ≈ 7 days recorded.

Data recorded at frame resolution (typically 25–30 fps, sometimes higher).

If you treat every frame as an event → astronomically huge.

But behavior logs are usually time-binned events (e.g., “Approach from frame 1000–1200”).

👉 So the effective dataset size depends on whether you:

Keep every frame (raw scale).

Compress into behavior bouts (1 token per event).

🔹 2. Rough size estimation

Let’s assume a compressed event log (which is what HRM will actually train on):

Say each animal has ~5,000 events per day (conservative for ethology).

7 days → 35,000 events per animal.

72 animals → ~2.5 million events total.

That’s large, but not huge by modern deep learning standards.

If you instead kept frame-by-frame (30 fps × 24h):

2.5 million × 1000 = several billions of tokens → impossible without downsampling.

👉 So: you must work with behavioral event tokens, not raw frames.

🔹 3. Model size & HRM needs

Sapientic’s HRM:

Original paper implementation ≈ 27M parameters.

This is smaller than a typical Transformer (e.g. GPT-2 small = 117M).

Optimized for low-data, low-compute domains.

That means:

Training on a single modern GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090, A6000, A100, or similar) is feasible.

Memory use is modest compared to vision models since inputs are discrete tokens.

🔹 4. Expected training setup

Batch size: 32–128 sequences (depends on sequence length).

Sequence length: truncate/pad to 500–1000 tokens (long enough to cover multi-minute behavior, short enough for memory).

Epochs: ~50–100 (self-supervised next-event prediction converges fast).

Time per epoch:

On a single RTX 3090/A100: a few minutes.

Full run: a few hours to a day.

If you want to experiment a lot (different tokenizations, ablations, hyperparams), access to a cluster or multiple GPUs will save you time — but it’s not strictly required.

🔹 5. Practical recommendation

Minimum viable setup:

1 GPU (RTX 3090 or better, 24 GB VRAM recommended).

32–64 GB system RAM.

Enough storage (few GB for data + checkpoints).

If scaling up (multiple tokenization experiments, larger vocabularies, factorized inputs):

2–4 GPUs will cut training times significantly.

Alternatively, cloud (AWS/GCP/Slurm cluster).

Not feasible: CPU-only training. Even though HRM is efficient, sequence models crawl on CPUs with millions of tokens.

🔹 6. Key bottlenecks

Preprocessing — turning frame-resolution data into clean sequences will take more time than the training itself.

Sequence length — if you insist on very long sequences (tens of thousands of tokens per animal), GPU memory becomes the limit. You’ll need to chunk into windows (e.g., 1000-token slices).

Exploration — since HRM is new in this domain, expect to run multiple exploratory trainings. Having one good GPU is essential.

✅ Bottom line:

Your dataset (18 experiments, ~2.5M events) is well within range for HRM.

A single modern GPU with ≥24 GB VRAM is enough.

Expect training to take a few hours to a day per experiment setup, not weeks.

The real bottleneck is preprocessing and designing the right tokenization scheme, not raw compute.

Would you like me to sketch an efficient preprocessing pipeline (from frame-res data → compressed behavioral tokens → HRM sequences), so you can estimate how much storage and preprocessing time you’ll need before even hitting “train”?

ChatGPT ha detto:

Perfect — thanks for sharing this example 🙌. This clarifies a lot about your data structure. Let me recap and then explain what it means for tokenization and compute load.

🔹 1. What your table actually represents

Each row = 1 mouse × 24h recording.
Columns = aggregated event statistics (counts, durations, means, medians, stds) for many behaviors:

Individual behaviors (e.g., Move_isolated, Stop_isolated).

Dyadic interactions (e.g., Approach_active_count, Approach_passive_count).

Group-of-3 / Group-of-4 behaviors (Group_3_make_count, Group_4_break_count).

Zones (Center, Periphery, etc.).

Sequential motifs (seq_oral_geni___oral_oral_active_count, etc.).

👉 This means your system is already preprocessing frame-level data into bouts, so the raw token load is way larger than my first conservative guess.

🔹 2. Token count per animal

From your example:

Approach_active_count = 10,323

Approach_passive_count = 10,451

Similar magnitudes for other behaviors (Move_isolated_count = 3,556, Contact_active_count = 2,395, etc.).

If we sum across all behaviors for this one mouse, one day, it’s tens of thousands of events.
For 4 mice × 7 days × 18 experiments →

👉 Billions of raw events in total if we keep them all as tokens.
This is definitely not directly feedable to HRM (or any Transformer) without downsampling / restructuring.

🔹 3. Implication for HRM training

HRM works on sequences of tokens. For your case:

If every event = 1 token → sequences could be 10k–50k tokens per day per mouse.

HRM (and most Transformers) handle ~500–2000 tokens per sequence well.

So you’ll need chunking:

Break each day per mouse into time windows (e.g., 30 min = ~1000 tokens).

Each window = 1 training sample (sequence).

This reduces the per-sample length and lets you cover the whole dataset by batching many windows.

🔹 4. Training dataset structure

After tokenization/chunking, your train/test data should look like this:

Format (conceptually):

Input = sequence of behavior tokens (time-ordered).

Target = next-token prediction (self-supervised).

Example (simplified):

Input: [Approach_active, Approach_passive, Contact_passive, Huddling, Move_isolated, …]

Target: [Approach_passive, Contact_passive, Huddling, Move_isolated, Social_escape, …]

Train/Test split:

By experiment:

Train: 6 WT, 2 mutant_1, 5 mutant_2.

Test: 2 WT, 1 mutant_1, 2 mutant_2.

Ensures the model doesn’t see test animals during training.

Alternatively:

By time: Train on days 1–5, test on days 6–7 (good for generalization over time).

🔹 5. Compute requirement (with this new scale)

Let’s re-estimate:

If 1 mouse/day = ~30k events = ~30k tokens.

Chunk into 1k-token sequences → ~30 samples per mouse/day.

4 mice × 7 days × 18 experiments = 504 mouse-days.

504 × 30 = ~15,000 sequences total.

That’s actually very manageable.
Even though raw counts are high, chunking reduces effective training size to tens of thousands of sequences, which fits comfortably into a single GPU training regime.

🔹 6. Key takeaways

Don’t feed raw billions of events. Chunk into manageable windows (e.g., 1k tokens).

Dataset size after chunking = ~15k sequences, which is perfect for HRM.

Compute requirement:

1 decent GPU (24 GB VRAM) is enough.

Training = hours, not weeks.

The bottleneck is designing the right token vocabulary (active/passive/group labels etc.) and preprocessing pipeline.

⚡ So: you have a huge raw dataset, but once structured for HRM, it shrinks into a very feasible training set.

Do you want me to map out a concrete tokenization scheme (how to collapse those 200+ columns like Approach_active_count, Group_4_make_count, etc. into a clean vocabulary of tokens HRM can consume)? That’s the crucial step before you can even test a train split.
